# watts_up_compute

## Code repo measuring several computational metrics associated with power consumptions of neuroimaging analysis
- Current metrics:
  - FLOPs
    - general purpose CPU counters: http://www.bnikolic.co.uk/blog/python/flops/2019/09/27/python-counting-events.html 
    - pytorch specific: https://github.com/sovrasov/flops-counter.pytorch
  - Energy 
    - https://github.com/powerapi-ng/pyJoules
    
- Compute tasks
  - Feature engineering (e.g. tangent space)
  - Scikit-learn model training and testing
  - UNet inference
