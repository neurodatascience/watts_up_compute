ENIGMA,Addiction/SUDs,118,18823,2016,7–68,"Mackey et al.5,84; Conrod et al.86","Common neural substrate shared in dependence; differential patterns of regional volume as biomarkers of dependence on alcohol and nicotine; lower volume or thickness observed, with greatest effects associated with alcohol use disorder; insula and medial orbitofrontal cortex affected, regardless of dependence."
ENIGMA,ADHD,37,4180,2017,4–63,"Hoogman et al.7,91; Klein et al.47; Zhang-James94; Hess et al.92","Reduction in bilateral amygdala, striatal, and hippocampal volumes in the ADHD population, especially in children; lower cortical surface area values found in children with ADHD, but not in adolescents or adults; lower surface area associated with ADHD symptoms in the general population in childhood; genetic association studies suggest that genes involved in neurite outgrowth play a role in findings of reduced volume in ADHD; gene-expression studies imply that structural brain alterations in ADHD can also be explained in part by the differential vulnerability of these regions to mechanisms mediating apoptosis, oxidative stress, and autophagy."

ENIGMA,OCD,38,3665,2017,5–65,"Boedhoe et al.6,88,167; Hibar et al.45","Subcortical abnormalities in pediatric and adult patients; pallidum (bigger) and hippocampus (smaller) key in adults, and thalamus (bigger) key in (unmedicated) pediatric group; parietal cortex consistently implicated both in children and adults; more widespread cortical thickness abnormalities in medicated adults, and more pronounced surface area deficits (mainly in frontal regions) in medicated pediatric OCD patients."
ENIGMA,PTSD,16,3118,2018,17–85,Dennis et al.76; Salminen et al.80; Logue et al.4; O’Leary et al.78,"Significantly smaller hippocampi, on average, in individuals with current PTSD compared with trauma-exposed control subjects, and smaller amygdalae."

ENIGMA,EEG,5,8425,2018,5–73,Smit et al.40,"Identified several novel genetic variants associated with oscillatory brain activity; replicated and advanced understanding of previously known genes associated with psychopathology (i.e., schizophrenia and alcohol use disorders); these psychopathological liability genes affect brain functioning, linking the genes’ expression to specific cortical/subcortical brain regions."
